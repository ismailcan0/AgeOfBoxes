Age of Boxes is a 2D side-scrolling strategy game developed in 48 hours, inspired by the classic Age of War.

The game features two opposing bases: one controlled by the player and one by an automated enemy.  
Players can use in-game gold to spawn weak or strong units depending on their strategy and current resources.  
The enemy base spawns units entirely at random, choosing between weak or strong units based on its available gold.

The match ends when either base is destroyed.

- Unity 2D
